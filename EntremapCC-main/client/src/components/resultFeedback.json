With self-confidence and optimism comes the belief in your ability to overcome barriers and build confidence in those around you. Whether you have passion, are sufficiently motivated and have the autonomy to implement your own systems…if you don’t have self-efficacy you have what you need (entrepreneurially speaking); self-efficacy enables you to control your world, believe in what you’re doing and your ability to achieve it, influence others to achieve your goals and take initiative where you see it. The higher your ESE the more you typically believe you are capable of successfully performing essential entrepreneurial activities, such as marketing, innovation, management, risk taking, and financial control…you believe in yourself! If you are a growth oriented entrepreneur you are more likely to show self-efficacy in strategies that focus on new technologies and market expansion, and willingness to incur opportunity costs (and assume risk) for the success of your business. ESE is a key component of a ‘can do’ motivation, which has consistently been linked to proactivity.

Intrapreneurs need to switch mental gears when moving from one subject to another, abandoning one way of thinking about a problem when it does not lead to a solution, adopting another way of thinking, and giving up erroneous information to accept new and more relevant information.

Cognitive flexibility is important for intrapreneurial opportunity recognition, customer intimacy (entrepreneurial empathy), and organisational performance. This flexibility involves the ability (cognitive control) to see that what one is doing isn't working and make appropriate changes (shift) to adapt to new situations, thinking about other options when the original plan is altered with an unexpected change, adapting quickly to changes or new situations, tolerating changes that may occur when problem solving or carrying out a task, creating more alternative solutions. Cognitive control involves the ability to switch ways of thinking, either automatically or deliberately, transitioning from one activity to another, seeing from different points of view and recognising hidden relationships which allow you to more easily find different solutions to the same problem, resisting the impulse to perseverate (keep thinking in a previously active but no longer appropriate manner), and disengage from one task and respond to another, or think about multiple concepts at the same time.

N-Ach motivates entrepreneurs to succeed in competition with other businesses, and to excel in activities important to them. You are more likely to seek challenges and a high degree of independence. Your most satisfying reward is more likely to be the recognition of your achievements. Take care though, not all high-need-for-achievement is considered positive…a constant, insatiable need to achieve can lead to anxiety and dysfunction, and that instead of happiness or well-being, high- N-Ach professionals seek \"relief in the accomplishment of tasks\" creating a cycle marked by a lack of a real sense of purpose.",
      "low": "If you score lower on need for achievement (N-Ach) it suggests that you might choose easy tasks in order to minimise risk of failure, or highly difficult tasks, such that failure might be reasonably expected and would not be embarrassing. Those with high N-Ach tend to choose moderately difficult tasks, feeling that they are challenging, but within reach. People high in N-Ach are characterised by a tendency to seek challenges and a high degree of independence. Their most satisfying reward is the recognition of their achievements…you can join them."

A growth mindset creates a passion for learning rather than a hunger for approval. Its hallmark is the conviction that human qualities like intelligence and creativity, and even relational capacities such as love and friendship, can be cultivated through effort and deliberate practice. Not only are people with this mindset not discouraged by failure, they don’t actually see themselves as failing in those situations — they see themselves as learning, also known as ‘flearning’.",

It involves positive emotional/motivational systems or processes of learning tasks related to entrepreneurship and incorporating new experiences in order to improve business (Jeraj, 2012; Jeraj and Antončič, 2013; Jeraj and Marič, 2013b). Entrepreneurial curiosity involves an interest in novelties or observations of society and a tendency to search for answers that indicate which demands should be met and it also represents guidance and competitive advantages for entrepreneurs relative to the competition (Jeraj and Marič, 2013a). Entrepreneurial curiosity is awake, when an entrepreneur is facing different stimuli related to activating their environment (Jeraj and Prodan 2010). Since this construct deals with different essential elements of entrepreneurship (e.g. market research, analysis of the competition, innovations, gathering important information and data, etc.) a relatively high level of entrepreneurial curiosity can represent value added in comparison to the entrepreneurs that have entrepreneurial curiosity on a relatively low level. Organizations (or communities) need to provide and develop a “cognitive infrastructure” that nurtures entrepreneurial thinking (Krueger, 2003). Entrepreneurial curiosity is a powerful engine in the generation of business ideas and curious entrepreneurs obtain appropriate data and make decisions based on them (Jeraj, 2012). Entrepreneurial learning helps entrepreneurs develop their skills and knowledge, and so enhances their future performance (Cope, 2005; Rae and Carswell, 2000, Parker, 2013). Curiosity, among other things, influences innovativeness. Jeraj and Antončič (2013) observe that motivated individuals with a relatively high level of entrepreneurial curiosity are more likely to be involved in entrepreneurial processes and contribute to the innovativeness and growth of the company. Entrepreneurial curiosity is connected with Openness, and entrepreneurial curiosity influences company growth as it leads to Innovativeness (e.g. Craig et al., 2013; Jeraj and Antončič, 2013; Jeraj, 2014). The most eﬀective “scalable learners” will be those driven by a genuine curiosity for learning. Educational opportunities that allow people to explore topics based on innate passions early and often will be highly beneficial in helping them to identify the best work experience, higher education options, and career paths to suit their areas of interest. A future orientation is fuelled by curiosity, with an optimistic disposition and focus on obtaining the skills and knowledge required to transition into future positions or careers. People with a future orientation have a high level of curiosity and view learning as a lifelong pursuit. They continuously explore trends across a broad range of technological, societal, economic, and environmental factors and formulate hypotheses that forecast how these dynamics may impact the status quo. And they maintain a positive outlook about getting to a better future, irrespective of challenges that may arise. Microsoft provides a good illustration of how important it is to develop curiosity and a future orientation in the twenty-first century, having put this concept at the center of its recently revamped company culture. In orchestrating one of the great corporate turnarounds of the last decade, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella became convinced that the company must move to a “learn it all” culture in place of its previous “know it all” culture. For Nadella, a “learn it all” culture is one where ALL employees make new learning, experimentation, and exploration of future trends a top priority. Curiosity is the leading light in this quest. In previous eras, the pace of change was much slower. Therefore, knowing a lot about the status quo was enough to sustain market leadership in many cases. But in an age of exponential change, everyone must adapt themselves to become a future-oriented continuous learner. In this way, you and your organization can respond quickly enough to market dynamics and threats that may come from completely unrelated industries or unanticipated sources. ",
